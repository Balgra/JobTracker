# Introduction 

My Job Applications Tracker

This web application is destined for all the students that want to track their own job application. This application
will help them increase their productivity by notifying them about their deadlines. 

The user will set the status of their job application, from sending the CV to getting test or the date for their interview.
Once this is set, the application will keep track of all the instances and when a deadline is near, it will send the user emails regarding their next step.

Our reasoning was that, these days many students want to apply for an intership, but applying at too many companies at the time, can be difficult,
so our application will solve this problem by keeping track of your status for all the companies you have applied. It is a very simple and effective application
because it will keep track of your status and you can easily verify what's next in your calendar.
